# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game that evolves over time based on its initial state, following a set of simple rules. Despite its simplicity, the Game of Life is capable of producing remarkably complex patterns and behaviors.

## How It Works

The Game of Life is played on a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by the following rules:

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
3. **Death**: In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead.

## Key Features

- **Emergent Behavior**: Simple rules lead to complex and often unpredictable patterns.
- **Patterns**: Includes still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships, each exhibiting unique behaviors.
- **No Player Interaction**: The game progresses autonomously from the initial configuration.

## Usage

To experiment with the Game of Life, you can set up an initial configuration of live cells on the grid and observe how the pattern evolves over successive generations.
